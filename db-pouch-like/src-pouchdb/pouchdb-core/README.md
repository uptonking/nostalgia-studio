# pouchdb-core

The core of PouchDB as a standalone package. This is a `preset` designed to be combined with other plugins to create new `presets` . By itself, it is not very useful.

### Usage

```bash
npm install pouchdb-core
```

```js
var PouchDB = require('pouchdb-core');
PouchDB.plugin( /* attach plugins to make me more interesting! */ );
```

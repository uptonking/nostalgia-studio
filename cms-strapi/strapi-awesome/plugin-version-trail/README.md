# notes
- The plugin is a middleware listening on the admin and user content management endpoints. 
  - Making changes directly to the records outside of this scope (e.g. from a custom service or controller) will not be logged as a revision by the plugin, however it shouldn't be difficult to manually implement this if needed.
